# broadlink-virgin-360-codes
IR blaster codes for the Virgin 360 box in the UK in Home Assistant for use with a Broadlink RM4 Mini, I assume this will work for other Broadlink devices but this has not been tested and verified.

The code snippet assumes you already have the Broadlink device set up in Home Assistant.

# Hardware Compatibility 
There are several different hardware models in use by Virgin for their 360 box and the codes generated in this repo may not be compatible with all models ( see https://github.com/jimb0b/broadlink-virgin-360-codes/issues/2 ). 

## Known working models
- HUMAX-EOS1008R-V003

(If you own this model but find the codes do not work, please let me know so I can update this README).

# Configuration
* Navigate to your `config/.storage` directory.
* Add the map in file `broadlink_remote_codes` to your Broadlink codes file, ensuring you keep the JSON syntax in tact.
* Restart the Broadlink integration.

# Initial code generation procedure

These codes were generated by purchasing a One for All URC7125 Evolve 2 remote and configuring it with magic code "1582", which was then used to train the Broadlink RM4 mini.
