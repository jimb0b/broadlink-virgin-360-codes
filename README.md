# broadlink-virgin-360-codes
IR blaster codes for the Virgin 360 box in the UK in Home Assistant. Works with a Broadlinke RM4 Mini, I assume this will work for other Broadlink devices but this has not been tested.

The code snippet assumes you already have the Broadlink device set up in Home Assistant.

To use:
* Navigate to your `config/.storage` directory.
* Add the map in file `broadlink_remote_codes` to your Broadlink codes file, ensuring you keep the JSON syntax in tact.
* Restart the Broadlink integration.
